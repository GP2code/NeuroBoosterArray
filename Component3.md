## GWAS hits for the array
See the table in this repo ```GWAS_HITS.txt```

## This table was used to calculate tag SNP distances across popuations in plink
```
For POP in 
```

## Tag interval generation
Outputs from tagging were merged and most distant tag SNPs per GWAS hit were identified across the 6 popualtions.  
250kb on each side of most distal tags were added to create intervals.  
Intervals can be found in the repo as part of ```GWAS_TAGs.txt```.
