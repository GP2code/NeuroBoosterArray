### Within each subheading, subsets of content will be ranked 1 - X, with 1 being the highest priority.

## Note: Janina is handling making the general impute booster for GSA. An impute booster is not needed for MEG.

## 2 content packs (different but compatible levels of filtering)

1. NeuroGlobo_Basic - tuned for GSA - 50-80K SNPs  
In order from most important to least  
-GWAS hits (200 variants)  
-HGMD variants (22K variants filtered for rsID, DM and not an indel)  
-KOL variants (2K variants)   
-NDD locus tagging variants (Sample across regions to fill out remaining beadpool)  

2. NeuroGlobo_XL - tuned for MEG - NeuroGlobo_Basic + additional 50K  
-Remainder of DM / non indel variants from HGMD (33K, ie those w/o rsIDs)  
-Fill out the rest with additional NDD locus tagging variants  

## Mandatory content on both backbones

1. 2K variants for risk profiling from NDD GWAS studies
2. HGMD extracted variants (differentially filtered for GSA and MEG arrays)
3. KOL Content from Boniface Mok (Asian risk variants), Hjelm (mito), Houlden (rare populations) and JC Corvol (additional pharmaco genetic variants)
