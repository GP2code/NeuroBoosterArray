# Neuro Booster Array
Repository for the Neuro Booster Array developed in part by Data Tecnica International, NIA, NINDS, GP2 and Illumina. We lovingly refer to it as the "NBA"!

## Summary
This is the online repository for the for the manuscript titled ***"NeuroBooster Array: A Genome-Wide Genotyping Platform to Study Neurological Disorders Across Diverse Populations"***. 

## Design Statement
Please see the content linked here for the [variants on the GDA array (the backbone of Neuro booster)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19RKjwB-HI8Cf9n3sP_gYpkg-_lusOcgK/view?usp=sharing) plus [custom content related to Neurodegenerative conditions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1li50Oin0ctVQTFN5O9ctIKJw4i5Acisu/view?usp=sharing).

## Concept
To make a content pack that will support the analysis of neurodegenerative disease (NDD) genetics. 

## Goals
We are aiming to:  
1. Identify coding and rare familial variants of interest to researchers on the NDD field.  
2. Improve imputation of known GWAS loci for NDDs across populations of diverse continental ancestries to facilitate trans-ethnic studies.  
3. Generally improve imputation quality across populations of diverse continental ancestries to facilitate risk locus discovery.  

## Content:

#### Component 1: HGMD systematic review and key opinion leaders

#### Component 2: Identifying multi-population tag SNPs.

#### Component 3: Dense Tagging of GWAS regions.

#### Component 4: Imputation boosters for diverse populations.
